There are two ways to use the python libgpod bindings.  Both methods use the
same namespace (gpod) for convenience.  Just "import gpod" to get started using
either of them.

The first method provides a 'Pythonic' API.  Most uses of this API will start by
opening the database with gpod.Database() and then calling methods on the
returned object.  For example, to read an iTunesDB from an iPod at /mnt/ipod
and print the title for the tracks in the database:

    import gpod
    db = gpod.Database('/mnt/ipod')
    for track in db:
        print track['title']

Please see ipod.py for the implementation details and the scripts in the
examples directory for some ideas on how to use the bindings.


The second method uses the same API as the C implementation.  Prefix the C
function names with gpod.  For example, to read an iTunesDB from an iPod at
/mnt/ipod and display the titles for each track:

    import gpod
    db = gpod.itdb_parse('/mnt/ipod', None)
    tracks = gpod.sw_get_tracks(db)
    for track in tracks:
        print track.title

See the libgpod C API documentation for the details and available functions.

Note: The C API is translated to Python using SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and
Interface Generator).  This automated translation sometimes exposes functions
which return data types that are not useful in Python and require helper
functions in the bindings.  An example is listing playlists; the C API would
return a GList which means nothing to Python, so a helper function is provided
that returns a Python list.  These helper functions are prefixed with sw_ to
denote that they are not native libgpod functions.

The current helper functions are:

@WRAPPER_LIST@

Please see the example scripts for ideas on how to use these functions.

This table means that as a user of the Python bindings, you likely
want to detect libgpod < r1417. One way would be to test for the
presence of some of the renamed constants in 0.5:

    # libgpod>= 0.5.2 doesn't use mac-type timestamps anymore.  check
    # if we're using a newer version by looking for a renamed constant.
    if hasattr(gpod, 'ITDB_SPL_STRING_MAXLEN'):
        track.time_released = int(time.mktime(ipod_date)
    else:
        track.time_release = int(time.mktime(ipod_date) + 2082844800

(Since r1633 there exists a gpod.version_info tuple, which will make
such things easier to cope with in the future.
