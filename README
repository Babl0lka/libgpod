libgpod is a library meant to abstract access to an iPod content. It provides
an easy to use API to retrieve the list of files and playlist stored on an 
iPod, to modify them and to save them back to the iPod.
This code was originally part of gtkpod (gtkpod.sf.net), when the iPod content
parsing code was made to be self-contained with gtkpod 0.93, we chose to put
this code in a separate library so that other project can benefit from it 
without duplicating code.
