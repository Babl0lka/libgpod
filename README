libgpod is a library meant to abstract access to an iPod content. It
provides an easy to use API to retrieve the list of files and playlist
stored on an iPod, to modify them and to save them back to the iPod.

This code was originally part of gtkpod (www.gtkpod.org), when the iPod
content parsing code was made to be self-contained with gtkpod 0.93,
we chose to put this code in a separate library so that other project
can benefit from it without duplicating code.

If you decide to make improvements, like support for cover art or
photos please contact us so we can work together. Just drop a mail to
Gtkpod-devel@lists.sourceforge.net (you may ask to be CC in the
answer).
